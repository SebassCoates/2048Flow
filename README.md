# 2048Flow

2048Flow uses machine learning implemented through TensorFlow in Go to 
optimally play the one-popular game 2048. 

This project takes inspiration from a close friend Kevin D. who tackled the
project of training a 2048 player in Matlab. I seek to implement a similar 
project as a way of learning Tensorflow (and Go)!
